To make sure that workshop code runs correctly:

1) Download the entire repository to a local directory
2) In the "data/fia/" folder, there are two zipped files. Extract all the files (.csv tables of selected FIA data) to the "data/fia/" folder.
3) Make sure that the paths specified in both code documents match your directories.

There are a whole bunch of packages that you'll need to run all the estimation code. In particular, you'll need Hunter Stanke's `rFIA` package, which you'll need to 
download from archive: https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rFIA/

You'll also need the `growMort_rewrite_METRIC.R` file, which contains the source code for rFIA functions that I've adapted to be able to do change estimation across
all western states. 

If you run into problems and/or mistakes in the code (and I'm sure there are at least a couple!), feel free to shoot an email to daniel.perret@usda.gov -- I'm happy to help however I can.
